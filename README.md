# Data-Mining
The repository contains the project did for the Data Mining Course at @KTH (EIT Data Science Master Programme)

## Description
The repo is divided into 5 folders. Each of the folder represents an assignment did for the course. All the different tasks are implemented using python.

### Finding Similar Items
It contains the code for finding similar documents using Min Hashing and LSH. Both of them are fast approximation to compute jaggard similarity.

### Association Rules
It contains the code for finding all the association rules given a set of baskets. The implementation is done following A Priori algorithm to generate all the possible combination and rules with a certain interest.

### Mining Data Streams
It contains the code for estimating the number of triangles in a graph following a given method (Triest) described in detail in this [paper](min_data_streams/triest.pdf).

### Graph Spectra 
It contains the code for computing the Spectral Clustering of a graph following the different steps given in this [paper](graph_spectra/clustering.pdf).
